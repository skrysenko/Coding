			<p><b><a name="company">Geoinformproekt LLC</a></b> is a team of professionals 
				representing the mix of youth and experience.<br>
				The history of our company began in 2000, when employees of the research laboratory of Land Managementand 
				GIS at the Chernihiv State Institute of Economics and Management CSIEM decided to create a 
				company to promote GIS technologies for application in solving practical problems, in particular, 
				for composing of landregister and development of geodatabases for the further applying in practical 
				training for students at thedepartments of Land Management and Cadastre and Geographic Information Systems 
				and Technologies as wellas a base for student graduate works. <br>

			<p>We have first started to use geodetic GPS-systems, ArcInfo (ArcGIS) and ERDAS Imaging software, 
				remotesensing materials and Internet / Intranet-technologies in the Chernihiv region.
				We do not focus only on land management. Over the years, we have developed a lot of practical 
				techniquesand gained invaluable experience in dealing with a wide range of objectives 
				(from the creation of commonthematic and topographic maps to implement system tasks) and a 
				large database of geoinformation.
				Our employees combine practical activities with teaching and research, taking part in international 
				and Ukrainian scientific-practical conferences as well as in scientific work at the department of 
				Geographic Information Systems and Technologies at the Chernihiv State Institute of Economics and Management 
				and implementing research programs funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.
				Scientific, educational and practical activities have been combined in our company for many years. 
				Manystudents have done their practical works in Geoinformproekt LLC. And some of them stayed as employees.
				With the development of our company it has become difficult to combine different activities, and 
				preferencewas given to the practical one.
				Today, we are focused on solving of various problems, but our commitment remains the same, 
				namely the GISand the desire to be at the forefront of this technologies.<br>
